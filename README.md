Use this template as the starting point for developing a new widget
for "ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, Developer Edition" (WABDE)

## Development

### Prerequisites

You can run WABDE anywhere you like. It's not hard, you have to get NodeJS 
installed and running. I am using Docker and will assume you do, too.

You can use [wildsong/wabde](https://hub.docker.com/r/wildsong/wabde) from Docker hub

The related github is at [Wildsong/docker-ArcGISWebAppBuilder](https://github.com/Wildsong/docker-ArcGISWebAppBuilder)
There are more notes on the workflow for widget development in the README there too.
